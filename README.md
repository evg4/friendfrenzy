## Project Title
Friend Frenzy
## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I created it on 17.08.23 to continue practising with the React library. The focus of this project was dealing with props and the useState() hook. When you click on a button, the number in "Love received" increases. Otherwise, there is no interactivity.
